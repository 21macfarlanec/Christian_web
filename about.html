			<p>
			Hello! My name is Christian MacFarlane and I am 14 years old. I am currently in 9th grade, and I attend Bordentown Regional High School, in Bordentown, New Jersey. My hobbies include; playing video games, coding, playing with my animals, and tinkering with electronics. My favorite color is blue. My favorite type of music is classic rock. My favorite coding language is HTML because I find it simpler than other coding languages I know such as JavaScript.

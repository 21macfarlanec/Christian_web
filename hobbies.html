			<h1> My Top 3 Hobbies </h1>
			<ol>
			<li> Playing video games </li>
			
				<p> I like playing video games because I find them competitive and I am a competitive person. I have also played them since I was really young, so I am addicted to them. </p>

			<li> Building things </li>
			
				<p> I like to build things out of items I find around my house. Whether the finished product will be useful or not, I still enjoy the process of building it. </p>
			
			<li> Playing with Arduino/other electronics </li>
			
				<p> During my free time, I like to make circuits and mess with other electronics. I often times do not get it to work the first time I try it, which makes it fun to diagnose the problem and try to fix it. </p>
